Image Quality Reducer (Python)
============================

It helps you reduce the image quality of a bunch of pictures at the same time so you can upload them to your blog. This will make your site's load time decrease.

This was thought for Windows usage mostly, although I think it can also work on Linux.


## Requirements

- Python 2.7
- PIL [Python Image Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)

## Usage

1. Select a group of images to reduce their quality.
2. Move the selected files over the file **img-reduce-quality.py** .
3. Select what quality you want the images to have (from 0 - 100) with 100 being high quality, and 0 being very poor quality. Then press Enter.

## Limitations

- It works only with JPEG images.
